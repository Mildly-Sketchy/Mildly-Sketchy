# Opportune

**Author**: Kat Cosgrove, Gene Pieterson, Patricia Raftery, Austin Matteson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Opportune is a web application that uses a web scraper and keywords from the user to find jobs in their area related to their chosen search terms. To use, the user must register or log in, choose their location and job keywords, and Opportune will email to them a list of 20 job postings within their specifications. At any time the user can go back and search again, with different keywords/city, or if they use the same they will not get the same job postings again. The user has the ability to unsubscribe to Opportune at any time.

## How It Works


## Getting Started
To replicate this app, you would fork and clone our GitHub https://github.com/Mildly-Sketchy/Opportune. Then you would need to start a virtual environment, install the packages to get the dependencies used in this app, and have 3 empty databases set up.

## Architecture
Three SQL databases are used for persistence to store job postings and user data. Pyramid is used for the framework, and the web scraper used is Beautiful Soup. Other technologies used are Python3, Travis CI, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Heroku is used for deployment.
